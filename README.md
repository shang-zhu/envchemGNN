# envchemGNN

this is the repository for manuscript 'Improved Environmental Chemistry Property Prediction of Molecules with Graph Machine Learning'. full code will be coming soon.

## to obtain the data, do the following:

1. you should put 'feature_result' folder as 'envchemGNN/model/feature-based/result_1', while 'feature_result_stand_scaler' folder as 'envchemGNN/model/feature-based/result_stand_scaler_1'

2. you should put 'data' folder as 'envchemGNN/data'

3. you should put 'deepchem_result' folder as 'envchemGNN/model/deepchem/publish/result'

4. you should put 'ognn_result' folder as 'envchemGNN/model/o-gnn/result', while 'ognn_graph_features' folder as 'envchemGNN/model/o-gnn/graph_features'
